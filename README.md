Maze Pathfinding Project
Description
This project implements and compares two algorithms for finding the shortest path in a maze: a classical search algorithm and Q-learning. The goal is to navigate from the start point to the goal point while taking the shortest path.

Algorithms
Classical Search Algorithm

Algorithm Choice: Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS)
Objective: To find the shortest path using a uniform or non-uniform search strategy.
Reinforcement Learning Algorithm

Algorithm Choice: Q-learning
Objective: To learn the optimal path through exploration and exploitation of the maze environment.
Test Cases
The algorithms are tested on three different mazes. The performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

Total Execution Time
Steps Taken
Nodes Expanded
Visualizations
Maze Representation: Visual plot of empty maze.
Path Taken: Visual plot showing the path taken by each algorithm.
Comparison Plots: Graphical comparison of metrics for the algorithms.
